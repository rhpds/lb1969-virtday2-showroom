== Configure Network Policies to manage VM Traffic

=== Introduction

To demo network policy, we have a standard VM, user logs in via console, can ping google or other public IP by default, show how we can set a network policy to block egress of that vm, or limit egress to only other VMs in the same namespace.

=== See that the VM can ping google

. Click VirtualMachines, click *rhel9-vm1* click Console. If you do not see any Virtual Machines make sure you are in vms-aap-day2 project.

. Click on the Console tab and using the provided login perform a ping test to google.com.

Note: There is a Copy to clipboard button and a Paste button available here, which makes the login process much easier.

. Once you are logged in, execute the following command:
.. Ping google.com

. Press Control +C to stop the ping.

. From the OpenShift console, Click on Workloads > Pods. Click on the pod name for *rhel9-vm1*.

. Add app=network-policy-deny to the labels and click Save.

. Repeat this process for  *rhel9-vm2*.

=== Create the Network Policy

. Under Networking click on *NetworkPolicies* then *Create NetworkPolicy*.

. In NetworkPolicies fill out these fields and Click *Save*.

.. Policy name: ping-egress-deny
.. Key: app
.. Value: network-policy-deny
.. Check Deny all egress traffic

. You can verify what pods are affected pods by the network policy.

=== See that the VM CANNOT ping google

. Go back to Virtualization > *Virtual Machines* and click *rhel9-vm1*.
.. Click on the *Console* tab and login to the VM
.. Enter the command ping google.com. You should get no responce.

. Once complete, delete the network policy you created.
