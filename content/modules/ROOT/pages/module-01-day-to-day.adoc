= Enabling Basic Day to Day Operations

== Setup AAP jobs (either via config as code or manually through the UI)

== Dynamic Inventories with AAP

== Security and Compliance [compliance operator]

=== Getting started

To set up a security scan, navigate to the Operators tab and select Installed Operators, then select the Compliance Operator.

+

This takes you to the operator details page, from here move to the ScanSetting tab
+
image::day-to-day/compliance_details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
Select Create ScanSetting
+
image::day-to-day/create_scansetting.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
In the ScanSetting yaml details, note the 'autoApplyRemediations' =False, the roles section includes both master & worker nodes,
and the name can be set according to your choosing.
+
image:day-to-day/scansetting_details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
Before moving on, there are quite a number of predefined profiles that can be used for scanning purposes on the 'Profiles' tab. 
Weâ€™ll use the fedramp moderate profile = rhcos4-moderate
+

+
Additional detail on these profiles can be found here- 
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/security_and_compliance/compliance-operator#compliance-operator-supported-profiles
The next step is to set up a ScanSettingBinding, navigate to that tab and select create ScanSettingBinding
+
image:day-to-day/create_scansettingbinding.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
In the ScanSettingBinding yaml details, the name (fedramp1) can be set to whatever you like.  Note the profile is set to rhcos4-moderate (the fedramp moderate profile), and the ScanSetting is set to the previously defined ScanSetting (scan1)
+
image::day-to-day/scansettingbinding_details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
After the ScanSettingBinding is created this will kick of the fedramp1 Compliance Suite
+
image::day-to-day/compliance_suite.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
This Compliance Suite (fedramp1) kicks off the defined profile (rhcos4-moderate) scans for each of the defined roles in the ScanSetting (master/worker) 
+
image::day-to-day/compliance_scan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
The scan takes ~3-4 minutes to complete, then you can check the failures on the ComplianceCheckResult tab.

== Configure Network Policies to manage VM Traffic

=== Introduction

To demo network policy, we have a standard VM.
The user logs in via console, can ping google or other public IP by default.
Show how we can set a network policy to block egress of that vm, or limit egress to only other VMs in the same namespace.

=== See that the VM can ping google

. Click VirtualMachines, click *rhel9-vm1* click Console.
If you do not see any Virtual Machines make sure you are in vms-aap-day2 project.
+
image::day-to-day/view_vm.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Click on the Console tab and using the provided login perform a ping test to google.com.
+
image::day-to-day/login_vm.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
NOTE: There is a Copy to clipboard button and a Paste button available here, which makes the login process much easier.
+
. Once you are logged in, execute the following command:
.. `ping google.com`
+
image::day-to-day/ping_site.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Press Control+C to stop the ping.
+
. From the OpenShift console, Click on Workloads > Pods. Click on the pod name for *rhel9-vm1*.
+
image::day-to-day/select_pod.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. In the Pod details section click Edit.
+
image::day-to-day/pod_details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Add app=network-policy-deny to the labels and click Save.
+
image::day-to-day/pod_label.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Repeat this process for *rhel9-vm2*.

=== Create the Network Policy

. Under Networking click on *NetworkPolicies* then *Create NetworkPolicy*.
+
image::day-to-day/networkpolicy.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. In NetworkPolicies fill out these fields and Click *Save*.

.. Policy name: ping-egress-deny
.. Key: app
.. Value: network-policy-deny
.. Check Deny all egress traffic
+
image::day-to-day/network_policy_configure.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. You can verify what pods are affected pods by the network policy.
+

=== See that the VM CANNOT ping google

. Go back to Virtualization > *Virtual Machines* and click *rhel9-vm1*.
.. Click on the *Console* tab and login to the VM
.. Enter the command ping google.com. You should get no responce.
+
image::day-to-day/ping_site_deny.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Once complete, delete the network policy you created.
