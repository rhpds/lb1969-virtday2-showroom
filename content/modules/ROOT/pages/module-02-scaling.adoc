= Real world scaling scenario

//, new capacity demands (45 minutes)

== Performance and Observability

=== Examine Load on Virtual Guests

=== Example graphs, logs, and alerts.

== Horizontally Scale Front End

=== Add more VMs

== Vertically scale Backend

=== Hotplug compute resources (cpu/memory)

. For this part of the lab we need to make sure that the load maker pod is running

+
. Click on *Workloads* > *Deployments* > *loadmaker*. Ensure you are in Project: *windows-vms*.

+
. In the VIrtualMachine Details under CPU | Memory section Click on *2 CPU | Gib Memory*
+

+
. Increase the vCPUs to 4 and Memory to 2 and Click Save
+
image::day-to-day/update_specs.png[]
+
. Click back on the *Overview* tab. You will see that the CPU | Memory section in the details has been updated to the new values.
+

+
. Repeat these steps for *winweb02*.

. Once both vms are upgraded in the project tree view click on *windows-vms* project. You will see that the CPU and Memory usage has gone down.
