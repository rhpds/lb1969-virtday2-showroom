= Real world scaling scenario

//, new capacity demands (45 minutes)

== Performance and Observability

=== Examine Load on Virtual Guests

=== Example graphs, logs, and alerts.

== Horizontally Scale Front End

=== Add more VMs

== Vertically scale Backend

=== Hotplug compute resources (cpu/memory)
