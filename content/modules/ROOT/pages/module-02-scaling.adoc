= Real world scaling scenario

//, new capacity demands (45 minutes)

== Performance and Observability

=== Examine Load on Virtual Guests

=== Example graphs, logs, and alerts.

== Horizontally Scale Front End

. For this part of the lab we need to make sure that the load maker pod is running

+
. Click on *Workloads* > *Deployments* > *loadmaker*. Ensure you are in Project: *windows-vms*.
+

+
. You should see 1 Pod under the Deployment Details tab.
+

+
. Click on *Environment* tab
+

+
. In *Virtualization* > *VirtualMachine* Select *windows-vms* project to show *winweb01*, *winweb02* and *database*. You should see high resource usage on *winweb01*.
+

+
. Click on the checkbox next to *winweb02*, Click on *Actions* > *Start* to power on *winweb02*
+

+
. After approximently 5 minutes the load will even itself out between both winweb servers.

== Vertically scale Backend

. Click on the *winweb01*.
+
image::day-to-day/select_vm.png[]
+
. Click on the *Configuration* tab
+
image::day-to-day/select_config.png[]
+
. In the VIrtualMachine Details under CPU | Memory section Click on *2 CPU | 1 Gib Memory*
+
image::day-to-day/edit_vm.png[]
+
. Increase the vCPUs to 8 and Memory to 4 and Click Save
+
image::day-to-day/update_specs.png[]
+
. Click back on the *Overview* tab. You will see that the CPU | Memory section in the details has been updated to the new values.
+
image::day-to-day/vm_new_spec.png[]
+
. Repeat these steps for *winweb02*.

. Once both vms are upgraded in the project tree view click on *windows-vms* project. You will see that the CPU and Memory usage has gone down.
